It is independent of any calendar and concepts like &quot;day&quot; or &quot;month&quot;. It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.</p><h1>Examples</h1> <p>Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.</p><pre><code>Timestamp start = ...; Timestamp end = ...; Duration duration = ...; duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds; duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos; if (duration.seconds &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; duration.nanos &gt; 0) { duration.seconds += 1; duration.nanos -= 1000000000; } else if (durations.seconds &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; duration.nanos &lt; 0) { duration.seconds -= 1; duration.nanos += 1000000000; } </code></pre><p>Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.</p><pre><code>Timestamp start = ...; Duration duration = ...; Timestamp end = ...; end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds; end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos; if (end.nanos &lt; 0) { end.seconds -= 1; end.nanos += 1000000000; } else if (end.nanos &gt;= 1000000000) { end.seconds += 1; end.nanos -= 1000000000; } </code></pre><p>Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.</p><pre><code>td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10) duration = Duration() duration.FromTimedelta(td) </code></pre><h1>JSON Mapping</h1> <p>In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an object, where the string ends in the suffix &quot;s&quot; (indicating seconds) and is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as fractional seconds.
