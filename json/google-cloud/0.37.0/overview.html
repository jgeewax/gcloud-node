<p>
  First, install <code>gcloud-node</code> with npm and require it into your project:
</p>
<div hljs>$ npm install --save gcloud</div>
<div hljs>var gcloud = require('gcloud');</div>
<p>
  If you are running your app on Google Compute Engine, you won't need to worry about supplying connection configuration options to <code>gcloud-node</code>â€” we figure that out for you.
</p>
<p>
  However, if you're running your app elsewhere, you will need to provide project details to authenticate API requests.
</p>
<div hljs>
// Compute Engine
var gcloud = require('gcloud');

// Elsewhere
var gcloud = require('gcloud')({
  projectId: 'project-id',
  keyFilename: '/path/to/keyfile.json'
});</div>
<p>
  The full set of options which can be passed to gcloud-node and sub-modules are <a href="#/docs">outlined here</a>.
